# Movie Review Mining
Data mining on movie reviews. Visualization with word clouds, word frequency, and bipartite networks. Sentiment analysis based on machine learning.

+ The file `scraping_word clouds_word frequency.ipynb` scraps film reviews from Douban, tokenizes words of the reviews, visualizes the tokenization results with word clouds and word frequency bar charts, and prepares the data (nodes and edges) for ploting bipartite networks with Gephi.
+ The folder `gephi` includes the `.gephi` files of plotting the bipartite networks between comment words and film attributes.
+ The file `sentiment_word2vec_svm.ipynb` conducts sentiment analysis on the film reviews by using Word2Vec and SVM.
